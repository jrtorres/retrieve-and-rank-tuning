		<field name="body">coverage follows the car . example 1 : if you were given a car -lrb- loaned -rrb- and the car has no insurance , you can buy insurance on the car and your insurance will be primary . another option , someone helped you to buy a car . for example your credit score is n't good enough to finance , so a friend of yours signed under your loan as a primary payor . you can get insurance under your name and even list your friend on the policy as a loss payee . in this case , we always suggest you get a loan gap coverage : the difference between the car 's actual cash value and the amount still owned on it . example 2 : the car you are loaned has insurance . you can buy a policy under your name , list the car on that policy and in case of the accident , your policy will become a secondary or excess . once the limits of the primary car insurance are exhausted , your coverage would kick in and hopefully pay for the rest . i specifically used the word hopefully , because each accident is unique and it 's hard to interpret the coverage without the actual claim scenario . and even with a given claim scenario , sometimes there are 2 possible outcomes of a claim .</field>

		<field name="body">that is a great question ! one i 'm sorry that you have to ask ... i 'm sorry for your loss . each stat 's department of insurance will have in its codes the specified time limits for filing claims , beginning the processing , and for making the payments . you may want to look there for your answer . the fact that your loved one passed so soon after purchasing the policy is always a red flag for the insurer , their first assumption is that there was a desperate health issue that led to the purchasing of the policy , and perhaps some dishonesty in the application answers . that is certainly not always the case , but that is how they treat it . they will ask for doctor 's statements , coroner 's or autopsy reports , police reports , whatever documentation they need to determine if the timing was coincidental , or expected . once they 've received all of the documentation , the process moves pretty quickly . i 'd expect the process to take between 6 weeks and 90 days , maybe longer , maybe sooner , depending upon how quickly everything is received . in any case , you will receive a payment for some amount . it will either be for face value of the policy , if they find in your favor , or for what had been paid in premiums over the length of time the policy had been issued , and some amount of interest , if they do n't . should the latter be the case , you do have the right to appeal , but you 'll need a good lawyer and some money to outlast the insurer 's lawyer and overturn the decision . if you feel that you 've been wronged by them , you have the right also to file a complaint with the state . if you do so , be nice to your agent , because unless they advised you to misrepresent the truth , or have you apply fr something that was n't appropriate , i can guarantee you they had no part in the decision that was made by the company , in fact , they will have been asked for a statement also , and would have had to tell their impression of your loved one 's health . i 'm sorry for your loss , and i hope everything works out for you . thank you for asking !</field>

		<field name="body">calling the life insurance company through which your policy was issued is the most sure way to find out who is named as beneficiary on the policy . you can do this while the insured is still alive , or after death . if the insured person is still alive and wants to change his/her beneficiary , it can be done with a simple form .</field>
