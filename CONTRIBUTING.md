# Introduction

Thanks for considering contributing!  Hopefully this repo will continue to provide a set of helper scripts for common
bits of analysis and setup for question answering (or information retrieval) tasks using the Watson APIs.

Additional example/samples, scripts as well as documentation are all welcome.  I do hope to stick to the Long Tail 
Question Answering task - so only evaluation and debugging of Retrieve-and-Rank or Discovery APIs.

# Ground Rules

* Add unit tests for updates to the scripts library (not required for examples)
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make
